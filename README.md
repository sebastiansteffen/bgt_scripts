# Introduction
This folder contains scripts I wrote to aggregate the Burning Glass Technology (BGT) Job Postings data.
It is relatively flexible and allows aggregations to different entity levels (i.e. employer, occupation (SOC) code, industry (NAICS) code, ...) at different time granularities (year, month).

The output consists of several files in long format that contain information on the main aggregation , skill cluster family (scf), skill cluster (sc), and skill (s) level.

I wrote these on the MIT Computing cluster - other users will have to update the file paths according to their folder structure.

If you find my scripts useful, I'd appreciate a callout! Good luck with your research!
